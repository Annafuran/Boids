# The flocking egg-cersize

A project for the course TNM095, AI for interactive media at Link√∂ping University.

The project idea was to create an interactive application where people can gain information and learn about the flocking algorithms. 

The flocking simulation is an implementation of the classical boid algorithm proposed by Craig Reynolds. The algorithm is extended with an enemy and obstacle avoidance. 
The main focus was to learn the user how the different steering rules affect the flock behaviour. 

The project was implemented using Unity.
